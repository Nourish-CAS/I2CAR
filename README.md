# IÂ²CAR: Intra- and Inter-Variate Consistency Contrastive Adversarial Representation Learning
IÂ²CAR is a lightweight framework for multivariate time series anomaly detection, addressing spatiotemporal entanglement and noise robustness. 
It decouples temporal and variable dependencies, then leverages contrastiveâ€“adversarial representation learning to separate noise from anomalies and enhance detection accuracy

## ðŸ”¹ Overall
IÂ²CAR is a lightweight framework for **multivariate time series anomaly detection**, addressing spatiotemporal entanglement and noise contamination.  
It decouples **temporal** and **variable** dependencies, and introduces a dual strategy to achieve robust detection.

## ðŸ”¹ Architecture
- **Temporal-view GNN** models channel-independent temporal consistency.  
- **Variable-view GNN** models inter-variable consistency.  
- **Cross-view alignment** highlights anomalies as disruptions between the two views.  

## ðŸ”¹ Optimization
- **Contrastive learning** enlarges the boundary between noise and anomalies within each view.  
- **Adversarial learning** further generalizes normal and noisy samples, strengthening robustness to noise.  
- The joint loss balances intra-view separation and inter-view alignment for stable optimization.

## ðŸ”¹ Performance & Justification
- Achieves **state-of-the-art F1 scores** across four benchmark datasets (MSL, SMAP, PSM, SWaT).  
- Demonstrates the **lowest F1 drop (F1-N)** under noisy conditions, proving strong noise robustness.  
- Maintains **lightweight complexity** with fewer parameters and FLOPs, suitable for edge deployment.
