# I²CAR: Intra- and Inter-Variate Consistency Contrastive Adversarial Representation Learning
I²CAR is a lightweight framework for multivariate time series anomaly detection, addressing spatiotemporal entanglement and noise robustness. 
It decouples temporal and variable dependencies, then leverages contrastive–adversarial representation learning to separate noise from anomalies and enhance detection accuracy

## 🌟 Overall
I²CAR is a lightweight framework for **multivariate time series anomaly detection**, addressing spatiotemporal entanglement and noise contamination.  
It decouples **temporal** and **variable** dependencies, and introduces a dual strategy to achieve robust detection.

## 🛠 Architecture
- **Temporal-view GNN** models channel-independent temporal consistency.  
- **Variable-view GNN** models inter-variable consistency.  
- **Cross-view alignment** highlights anomalies as disruptions between the two views.  

## 🔹 Optimization
- **Contrastive learning** enlarges the boundary between noise and anomalies within each view.  
- **Adversarial learning** further generalizes normal and noisy samples, strengthening robustness to noise.  
- The joint loss balances intra-view separation and inter-view alignment for stable optimization.

## 📊 Performance & Justification
- Achieves **state-of-the-art F1 scores** across four benchmark datasets (MSL, SMAP, PSM, SWaT).  
- Demonstrates the **lowest F1 drop (F1-N)** under noisy conditions, proving strong noise robustness.  
- Maintains **lightweight complexity** with fewer parameters and FLOPs, suitable for edge deployment.
